# Hangman

This game is my Unit 3 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.  

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive word guessing game similiar to hangman in which the HTML is dynamically updated using Javascript.

## How to Play
* Guess individual letters until you successfully fill in each letter of the word to guess. 
* Upon opening the webpage, the application has already selected a random word to be guessed. Begin by typing a letter.
